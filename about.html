            <h2 id="about">About Luke Ken!</h2>
            <p>                  
            Luke Ken is a video game character designed and made by ZNukem. If you'd like to learn a bit about the history of Luke Ken, head over to the history page to find out more about it. The project started as a passion project for creating assets and tools for everyone to use. But it's grown beyond just that. We're not just building assets for a game, we're creating a cool character that can be used in different games and projects, sparking endless ideas. This why this website and other LK ideas exist.
       
             <h2 id="current">Current Status So Far!</h2>
        
            One of the games currently being made, Luke Ken 3D, is a free and open-source game that also provides a collection of free assets and resources for use. These assets, initially created for the DN3D Engine, are available for use in various game projects beyond the DN3D Engine. Free assets allows us made to make our free open source game. The goal is to make something fun and different game at same time. Can be used on any source port that supports it outside the box. 

            <h4> What if something goes wrong LK3D?</h4> If it does then we can shift this LK3D project and assets to new engine, We might use Godot something doesn't work out or develop on another LK project that is not related. No worries.
