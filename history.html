                <h3>Origin of Luke Ken</h3>
                <p>
                    The idea for Luke Ken originated from ZNukem (The Creator of Luke Ken) and was initiated in November 2020. One of ZNukem's friends, Starbuckmoko, expressed a desire for a free copy of DN3D. ZNukem, inspired by Freedoom, had the thought, "Why not create a 'free duke' project?" However, it became apparent that using a name too similar to Duke Nukem wouldn't be suitable. As a temporary measure, ZNukem named it "Project Jack," which was a code name previously used for a future game being developed in UE4.
                </p>
            
                <h3>Before Luke Ken</h3>
                <p>
                    Prior to the creation of Luke Ken, ZNukem conducted research and stumbled upon a project called Dave3D. Initiated by leilei in 2008, Dave3D aimed to develop a 'free duke' game and was created by the same person who made Open Arena. Leilei was also the founder of four other FOSS (Free and Open-Source Software) data projects with her group FSFPS. However, due to misunderstandings with 3D Realms, the former owner of the Duke Nukem franchise, Dave3D encountered numerous challenges and was eventually asked to cease development. It is possible that Dave3D borrowed heavily from Duke Nukem, with weapons like the RPG and Pipe Bomb, as well as the HUD, bearing striking similarities in design. There have been rumors suggesting that she faked a cease and desist letter to escape from continuing the project.

                    Learning from this experience, ZNukem made a conscious decision to avoid replicating what Dave3D had done and instead embarked on a new venture. The goal was to create something original and new game for the DN3D engine while still capturing the nostalgic graphical style reminiscent of the 90s, but without directly borrowing elements from Duke Nukem or facing potential legal issues.

                <h3>The Name Luke Ken</h3>
                <p>
                    The name "Luke Ken" was actually a result of a mistake in remembering the name of Commander Keen. However, it stuck in ZNukem's (The Luke Ken Creator) mind and seemed like a fitting choice, In faith It did happen incorporating references to Duke Nukem and Ken Silverman (the creator of the Build Engine). It paid homage to the software licenses and resonated with ZNukem, representing a fresh and innovative character within the open-source gaming world.
                </p>
            
                <h3>Development</h3>
                <p>
                    Development of Luke Ken began on November 26, 2020. Starting with placeholder sprites from the ZDoom Site, ZNukem explored different ideas and gradually transitioned to a classic sci-fi concept. Unique assets were developed to provide a fresh and distinctive experience, drawing inspiration from games such as Blake Stone, Duke Nukem 2, and Commander Keen.  It was during this phase that the creator began acquiring new skills, learning how to create their own assets using tools like Krita and color palettes. This involved crafting sprites, textures, and even screens specifically for the project, contributing to the overall vision of Luke Ken.

                <h3>Collaboration and Expansion</h3>
                <p>
                    Throughout the development process, ZNukem collaborated with highly talented individuals. One notable contributor was THEBarausII, who served as one of the maintainers and made substantial contributions in areas such as textures, switches, and skyboxes. Another noteworthy contributor was RS300, who created the main theme of Luke Ken, known as "Rock City and Roll" or simply RC&R.mid. Many other individuals also joined the project over time, offering their valuable input and feedback. The involvement of the community played a crucial role in shaping the evolution and growth of Luke Ken.
                </p>
            
                <h3>The Ideas</h3>
                <p>
                    ZNukem envisioned Luke Ken as a stylish space enforcer with a distinctive suit, blue visor shades, and cool short brown hair. However, due to limitations in color choice for Luke Ken's enforcer suit, the character had to be blue to accommodate changes for player colors in multiplayer. The original marine group name, "Galactic Forces Division," later changed into the "Galactic Task Force" sound more fitting. Luke Ken's character represents a blend of heroism, humor, strength, and seriousness, symbolizing the open-source community's pursuit of innovation and freedom.

                <h3>Going Public</h3>
                <p>
                    On June 11, 2023, ZNukem took a significant step by releasing all the raw Luke Ken assets to the public on GitHub. This move aimed to make the project accessible for collaboration and further development. The project is currently licensed under BSD, similar to Freedoom, with plans to transition to the CC0 license in the future.
