                <p>
                    The journey includes facing menacing insectoids, rinosauraus, formidable drone scanners, cyber turrets, eerie decayed slimer hive-like creatures, and more. Your mission is clear: arm yourself with advanced weaponry, explore Twilight City, 
                    and embark on space adventures. Your ultimate goal is to eliminate the alien leader and save humanity. Along the way, you'll encounter open-source characters and even some anime-like babes.

                    Plot WIP: The events unfold in the year 2649. You assume the role of Luke Kensington (also known as Luke Ken), a futuristic Space Enforcer Commander. Luke is a young and attractive male in his early 30s, 
                    seemingly ageless, working within the Galactic Task Force (GTF) by Captain Armstrong side. From last Issue #2 after returning from another planet following a big battle where he defeated an evil alien leader that sent a fake 
                    distress call to their planet to trap him but failed, which provoked different alien races to start an invasion on Earth. As you arrive, you have to shut down a dome from a alien space center in the first level.
                    This action alerts their colony ship during that first Episode. As Luke returns to Earth, he crash-lands at a galactic airport. As he makes his way out, he finds himself in Twilight Square, exploring a big park square with a theater and night club around town. 
                    many levels in.. As he cleans up the threat, he thinks he's done and saved Earth, but the adventure is far from over as G.T.F space enforcer. The colony ship arrives to keeps him on his feet in Episode 2. 
                    He has to head to space track down the leader but gets away that leads to Episode 3. As Luke finds the leader he defeats them, his strength gains recognition among alien species across the universe. 
                    An alliance forms between these species and humanity, fostering acceptance of extraterrestrial beings on Earth. Luke enjoys a peaceful period with a woman partner by his side, but four years later, 
                    an unexpected alien invasion disrupts his book event "Why I'm So Awsome" and sets the stage for the next chapter in Issue #4 including return of female cyber villain from Issue #1.
